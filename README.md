# Amnesia Tron Brute Force

This script is designed to automate the generation of seed phrases and the checking of balances on the Tron network. If a wallet with a non-zero balance is detected, the wallet's detailsâ€”including address, mnemonic, private key, and balanceâ€”are logged and saved to a file named `result.txt`.

## Usage

To begin the brute force process, run the `tronbrut.exe` executable. The script will continuously generate seed phrases and check the balances of the corresponding wallets. Information about each checked wallet will be logged to the console. If a wallet with a non-zero balance is discovered, its details will also be appended to `result.txt` in the project directory.
